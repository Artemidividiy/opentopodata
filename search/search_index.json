A config might look like this: max_locations_per_request : 100 datasets : - name : test-dataset path : tests/data/datasets/test-etopo1-resampled-1deg/ - name : etopo1 path : data/etopo1/ Config spec max_locations_per_request : Requests with more than this many locations will return a 400 error.

This path is relative to the repository directory inside docker. I suggest placing datasets inside the provided data folder, which is mounted in docker by make run . Required. Adding datasets An important goal of Open Topo Data is make is easy to add new datasets. The included dataset is very low resolution (about 100km) and is intended only for testing. Adding a new dataset takes two steps: placing the dataset in the data directory adding the path to the dataset in config.yaml . Open Topo Data supports all georeferenced raster formats supported by GDAL (e.g, .tiff , .hgt , .jp2 ). Additionally, collections of multiple files are supported if they follow the SRTM naming convention ( N30W120.hgt ).
